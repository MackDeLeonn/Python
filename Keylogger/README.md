# Keylogger Project

## Disclaimer
### This project was developed strictly for educational purposes in a controlled malware analysis sandbox. It is intended to help understand how keyloggers operate so that security professionals can better detect, prevent, and defend against similar threats. It must never be used for malicious or unauthorized activity under any circumstances.

## Purpose
### Developed a Python keylogger in a sandbox environment in controlled mode to simulate malicious activity for learning purposes. This project was focused on gaining knowledge about malware functionality, system input capture techniques, and detection methods in Windows Operating System. Emphasized ethical concerns, safe containment practices, and responsible security research.

## Directions
### Install the pynput library by using "pip install pynput"
### Save keylogger.py and run with "python keylogger.py"
### Logs each key with timestamps in keylog.txt in the same file
### Stop it by using CTRL+C
### To clear your text file in the terminal, use "> file.ext"
###
###

### When using 2 devices, make sure you change the receiver's IP address in the code


## Platform and Language
### Pythonc, pynput

## Future Plans
### Log mouse movement and clicks
